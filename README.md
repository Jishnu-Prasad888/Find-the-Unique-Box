<h1>PUZZLE</h1>

>**Question**
> You have been given 10 boxes with 10 balls in them each. In nine of the boxes the balls weigh 10 grams each but in one of the boxes the balls weigh 9 grams each . You have been given a weighing machine and have only one try to find the box


>**Puzzle Solution**
>Lets number the boxes from 1 to 10
>
>take out the number of balls form the box as much as the box number for example we take out 3 balls from box 3 and 5 balls from box five until we have a total of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10= 55 balls
>
>Now lets assume all th balls weigh 10 grams each so the total weight must be 550 grams
>
>Lets put the balls on the weighing machine and let the reading be x
>
>Now x is not equal to 550 as in one of the boxes the balls only  weigh 9 grams hence there is a difference in weight 
>
>Let the difference in weight be y
>
>Y is the box number. How? : Lets assume the balls weighing 9 grams were taken out of box number 4 and balls of 10 grams were taken out of all the other boxes hence the total weight comes out as (1+2+3+5+6+7+8+9+10)*10 + 4*9 = 546 . now lets substract 550 from 546 we get 4 which is the box number
